Ship a small service in AWS
===========================

## Exercise:

We want to deploy this small service in the cloud.

## Acceptance criteria:

- there should be a small script or a program which we can use to deploy our code in AWS. The service should be highly available.

- use some kind of log aggregation, so we can easily inspect the logs produced by the service
without access to servers or containers.

- short documentation of the setup. Also document why you chose a particular framework, service or technology. 

- (optional) monitor the number of redirects triggered by the service.

## Hints:

- the code is go-gettable:

		go get github.com/WeltN24/exercise-aws-01

- you have the freedom to choose any technology you think it makes sense

- commit frequently so we can see how you have approached the problem

## How to contribute your solution:

1. Fork the repo
2. Commit everything that you do in your fork
3. Create a pull request with your solution. Your pull request should include all source code which you used to create your solution.
